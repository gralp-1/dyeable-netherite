# DyeableNetheriteMkIII
The 3rd rehash of dyeable netherite. This time we might fix bugs.

## Dyeable Netherite:

Dyeable Netherite is a relatively simple Minecraft mod which was inspired by a resource pack made by Ph1lza.
This adds 5 different colored sets of Netherite tools and armor to the game, which are similar in style to the aforementioned resource pack, each with different colours and survival friendly crafting recipes.


## Installation
Dyeable Netherite is a mod built for the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/). It requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) to be installed separately. The mod can be downloaded [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dyeable-netherite). If you need help installing fabric mods to your client [here is a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCin6udCqa8)
